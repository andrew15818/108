# Hello, and welcome to my spring 108 semester repo!

This semester, I am only taking elective courses, so this
repo probably won't see as much activity. However, the classes
I am taking will very likely be challenging. So far, they are:

1. **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**: In this course, 
the fundamentals of searching and adversarial search, neural 
networks, reinforcement learning etc... Much homework and 
projects too!

2.**Introduction to Pattern Recognition**: In this course, 
we will use different Python libraries to understand the 
Pattern Recognition fundamentals. We will use libraries
such as NumPy, PyTorch, Keras and TensorFlow. 


# 大家好， 歡迎來到我108下學期的repo

本學期我僅修選修課，所以這個repo可沒有那麼多更新。不過，
選的課程可能比較重一點。到現在它們是：

1. **人工智慧概論**:本課會學到各種搜尋演算法，還有
不好翻譯成中文的內容哈。

2. **圖形認別概論**本課也是用到數學拿出圖片的特色。
