	\item 
		\textbf{Suppose we have three colored boxes $R$ (red), $B$ (blue), 
		and $G$ (green). Box $R$ contains 3 apples 4 oranges, and 3
		guavas, box $B$ contains 12 apples, 4 oranges, and 4 guavas. If
		a box is chosen at random with probabilities $p(R)=0.2,p(B)=0.4,p(G)=0.4$
		and a piece of fruit is removed from the box (with equal probability of selecting
		any of the items in the box), then what is the probability of selecting guava? If
		we observe that the selected fruit is in fact an apple, what is the probability
		that it came from the blue box?}

		For the second question, let $a$ be the event of choosing an apple.We are trying to find the 
		probability that the apple comes from the blue box, or $p(a|b)$. However, we can
		use \textbf{Baye's Theorem} to calculate the probability. This theorem says 
		\[p(a|b) = \frac{p(b|a)p(a)}{p(b)} \]
		We are told that $p(B) = 0.4$,
		
	\item
		\textbf{Using the definition} \[\textrm{var}[f] = E[(f(x) - E[f(x)])^{2}] \]
		\textbf{show that $\textrm{var}[f(x)]$ satisfies}
		\[\textrm{var}[f(x)] = E[f(x)^{2}] - E[f(x)]^{2}\]
