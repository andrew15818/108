# Hello, and welcome to the repo for the fall semster of the 108(2019-2020) school year.

## Some of the classes I am taking this semester

- **Introduction to Algorithms**: The programming assignments for this course all came from
the [NCTU Online judge](oj.nctu.me) page, where the professor assigned unique problems for 
students. Also are my review(cheat) sheets in LaTex which we were allowed to take into
examinations. 

- **Introduction to Graphics**: This course focused on introducing the basics of OpenGL,
we first created basic shapes, applied a texutre to a rotating sphere to simulate the Earth,
applied shading to a sphere, and for the last project simulated an explosion.

- **Introduction to Compiler Design**: Throughout the semester, we slowly built our own compiler,
which took as a source language a reduced version of Pascal, and we had to perform lexical
analysis, parsing, symbol table construction, and code generation.

- **Science Fiction Film and Culture**: A fun course where we studied the origins of science 
fiction and different portrayals of it in different movies/shows. My final essay dealt with 
the video game Bioshock and how a society such as that would have a hard time functioning. 


# 大家好，歡迎來到我的民國108-109學年度的repo

## 本學期修的課程如下 

- **演算法概論**：在這門課我們用交大的線上判斷網頁 [NCTU Online Judge](oj.nctu.me).在此
教授發獨特的題目練習各種演算法。這裡也有我複習的檔案，用LaTex來寫。


- **計算機圖學概論**：這門課裡面主要是介紹OpenGL顯示方式。作業上我們我們先畫幾顆球模擬
太陽系，第二份作業要把質地放在球上畫地球。第三作業要把燈光亮到球上用Phong Shading 及
Giroud Shading。最後一份作業要模擬爆炸。

- **編譯器設計概論**：這裡慢慢寫自己的編譯器從Pascal編到Risc V 還是Java Bytecode.我們
首先做semantic analysis， 再parse和建AST，寫symbol table，最後發code.

- **科幻電影與文化**: 這門蠻有趣的，我們學到科幻從一開始到現在在媒體上的代表，我期末
文章關於2007年的Bioshock遊戲還有它的社會問題。
