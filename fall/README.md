# Hello, and welcome to the repo for the fall semster of the 108(2019-2020) school year.

## Some of the classes I am taking this semester

- **Introduction to Algorithms**: In this class, most of the work comes from homework
assignments and written assignments. Topics include the standard ones: sorting, dynammic
programming, trees, graphs, etc... However, the problems can get quite involved in the
homework assignments.

- **Introduction to Graphics**: At the time of writing, I don't know exactly what we will
cover, but we will use OpenGl for our assignments. 

- **Introduction to Compiler Design**: In this course, we studied the basics of the compilation
process. We designed a primitive lexical/syntactical analyzer.
