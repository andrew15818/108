\subsection{Chapter 1: basics}

\subsubsection{What is an algorithm?}
By definition, an algorithm is just a procedure to turn some input into some output through some
calculations.

\subsubsection{Selection Sort}
\textbf{The Champion Problem:}
The champion problem inputs an array \textit{A} of n integers.

The program outputs an index such that A[k] is the minimum value.

We can solve this problem by looping through the array and selecting the least element as we find.
This takes $4n+c$ comparisons.
\subsubsection{sorting problem}
Given a matrix of n integers, output the elements of the array in non-decrementing order.
\subsubsection{Selection Sort}
The idea behind selection sort is to use the \texttt{findMin()} procedure described above to sort an array.
With an array of n elements, we find the min of n elements and place it in A[0]. Then, we find the min of 
n-1 elements and place it in A[1],... For each element $a_{i}$ in the array, we loop over the remaining
n-i elements, which means that we have to perfom $n(4n+c+3)$ calculations. 

\textbf{Why does no. of calculations matter?} Means that for bigger n, the number of calculations grows 
significantly.
\subsection{Insertion Sort}
The main idea is that we maintain a sorted array of length \textit{i}, and then we take an element from 
the unsorted part of the array and insert it into its corresponding place in the sorted part. However,
when the array is sorted backwards, we will perform many, many more calculations.

\subsection{Asymptotic notation: O-Notation}
$f(n) = O(g(n))$ means that: 
\[ h(n): \exists N,c \rarrow \forall n\geq n_{0}, ch(n) \geq f(n) \]
