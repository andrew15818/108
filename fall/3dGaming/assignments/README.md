# 3D Game Programming
In this course, we introduced the Ogre3D game engine, and practiced the basics of
game design. Over the course of three assignments, we practiced the physics, motion,
animation, scene creation, etc... involved in making increasingly complex scenes. 
Due to the size of all the additional files (we worked in visual studio), here I just
included the source files. The directory structure would have to be quite different to 
be able to run these. 

-**Assignment 1**: For the intrductory assignment, we created a simple scene, with one 
penguin in the center and another, smaller, penguin rotating around the larger one. 

-**Assignment 2**: This assignment involved creating a series of robots in their idle
animation around a center fire, and being able to select a group of them using a ray 
query and moving them to anywhere else on the map. This required some basic collision 
detection and performing the mouse query, which could be a little complex in Ogre3D.

-**Assignment 3**: The final assignment involved creating a scene in which several 
enemies bounce up and down while chasing the player. The player has a gun which he
can use to shoot.
