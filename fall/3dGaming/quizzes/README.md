## Quizzes

This course's quizzes involved mostly practicing a single concept, which we then
had to answer questions on during the demo. 

-**Quiz 1**: This quiz required to mostly practice the hierarchical structure 
when creating several objects. When we move one object, all the objects attaced
to that will also move. We created a platform with a penguin, and when we move
the platform, the penguin should also move. 

-**Quiz 2**: Here we create a large sphere and many smaller spheres in a single 
space. When we move the larger sphere, it collides with the smaller spheres and 
we need to mostly do collision detection by measuring the difference of the 
distances and using that vector.

-**Quiz 3**: Here we needed to create a scene with some obstacles and create a 
character. Then, when we select another place on the screen, we calculate the
path the character has to take using the a\* algorithm.

-**Quiz 4**: For the final quiz, we had to calculate the motion of several spheres
that were dependent on each other, and calculate their respective collisions
with a larger sphere in the center.
