\section{Introduction}
For the final project of the 3D gaming course project, our original idea revolved around creating a 
room escape game, where the player had to first escape a room, then further escape a courtyard, to 
eventually leave the home. The player would first have to procure a key, after which the home door
would be available to open. Once the player was in the courtyard, after escaping the main home, then 
some monsters would come and pursue the player. The main objective of the game was to escape the 
courtyard as fast as possible; there would be a counter somewhere on the screen for the player to 
know how much time he had taken.
