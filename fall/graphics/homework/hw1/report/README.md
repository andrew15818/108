# Some complications with Visual Studio

Dear 楊政軒, 王心瑩， 黃兆宇， 

I originally wrote my .cpp file in Linux, and tested it without using Visual Studio. When trying to generate the
project files to turn in, I got an error #1104 in Visual Studio. This is a Linker error, in this case the linker failed 
to find 'glut32.lib'. I tried going over the installation procedure in the tutorial over again, and then I created an
entirely new project to try and start over again. This did not help, since the error message kept appearing. I am of course
still turning in my cpp file, but my project file may be wrong.

I am extremely sorry for the inconvenience this caused.
